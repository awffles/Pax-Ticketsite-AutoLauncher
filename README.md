# Pax-Ticketsite-AutoLauncher

Google Chrome Extension that acts as a SignalR Client to the <a href="https://github.com/s-palermo/Pax-Ticketsale-Checker">Pax-Ticketsale-Checker Site</a>

## About

This Chrome Extension acts as a SignalR Client to the Pax-Ticket-Checker server.  It waits for the server to broadcast a message announcing
that a tweet has gone out from @PAX_Badges for the ticket sales.  The client then automatically opens up a browser window/tab with the ticket
sale location allowing you to skip the thousands long queue that always forms and securing your place in line so you're able to buy the
exact ticket dates you want.

#### Note

This server is not always running.  It is taken down in between ticket sale date ranges in order to cut down on costs.  
If it is comming close to a sale date and there is no link for the site or it is down please open an issue.

If the Pax-Ticketsite-Autolauncher extension's popup icon is greyed out it means the server is currently down.
